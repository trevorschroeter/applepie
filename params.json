{"name":"Tyson's Apple Pie Recipe","tagline":"Because I lose it every year.","body":"###The History\r\n \r\nOn October 14, 2003, Trevor made a batch of Apple Pie, and it was delicious.\r\nHe shared the recipe via email.\r\n\r\nThankfully Tyson took a picture of the email, because Trevor lost the recipe.\r\n\r\nTrevor has basically made a tradition of losing the recipe and has relied on Tyson to send it to him every winter.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate ten years of Tyson safely keeping the recipe, and providing it on-demand, this page has been set up so that everyone can have access to the recipe without having to bug Tyson.\r\n\r\n###The Ingredients\r\n```\r\n2 quarts fresh apple cider\r\n1 quart apple juice\r\n1.5 cups white sugar\r\n4 cinnamon sticks\r\n3-4 cloves (optional)\r\n1 pint Everclear\r\n```\r\n\r\n###The Instructions\r\n```\r\nPlace all ingredients in a pot\r\nBring to a boil\r\nReduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes\r\nLet cool\r\nRemove cinnamon sticks and cloves\r\nAdd Everclear\r\n```\r\n\r\n###The Notes\r\nStir occasionally until sugar is dissolved, otherwise it might burn on bottom of the pan\r\n\r\nIf you can't find fresh apple cider, use 3 quarts of [Simply Apple juice](http://www.simplyorangejuice.com/product/apple.jsp) - that works well.\r\n\r\nCinnamon sticks are expensive if you buy them from the spice aisle at the grocery store - \r\nGet them in bulk from Costco, or a mexican grocery store for about 1/4 the price.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
